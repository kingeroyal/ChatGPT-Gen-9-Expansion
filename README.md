[Terastallization]


Pokemon Scarlet & Violet introduced Terastallization and here is what it does:
Terastallizing exchanges your Pokémon’s current types for your Tera type. For example, if you have a Poison / Ground cross-type like Paldean Wooper, and its Tera type is Grass, then it will become only a Grass type defensively and take on Grass’s weaknesses and strengths, such as resisting Water and being weak to Fire-type attacks.

When you Terrastalize, you will also gain 1.5x bonus damage for moves of your Tera type. In the above example, your Paldean Wooper would gain bonus damage for any Grass-type attacks it performed. However, it doesn’t lose its original same-type attack bonus, or STAB, meaning that it would get its usual bonus to damage for Poison- and Ground-type moves.

It’s worth noting that if your Tera type is the same as one of your original types, the bonuses from STAB and Terrastallization will stack. If your Wooper’s Tera type was Poison, then it would deal 2x damage with Poison attacks when Terrastalized compared to 1.5x when it isn’t.

How Does Terastal Phenomenon Work in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet - Terastallize for enhanced STAB or new changed defense on Nintendo Switch

Furthermore, when discussing how the Terastal phenomenon works in Pokémon Scarlet and Silver, it’s worth mentioning that you’ll receive the TM for Tera Blast after beating a few gyms. This is a move that, if used while Terastallized, deals damage of the Pokémon’s Tera Type and uses whichever stat is higher of the Pokemon’s Special Attack and Attack. If your Pokémon doesn’t learn any other moves of its Tera type, Tera Blast will always allow you to make use of the bonus damage from it.

All of this means that, sometimes, having a Tera Type the same as the Pokémon’s usual type isn’t a bad thing, since it increases your damage. On the other hand, having a different Tera type can help you defensively, by changing your type weaknesses, or allow you to hit Pokémon extra hard with move types that would normally not receive STAB.

There is a New Type you can only get via Terastallization. Terastallizing to a Stellar Type (The New Type) doesn't change your defensive attributes. When a Pokémon Terastallizes into the Stellar type, it gains an attack boost for every move type, but only once per type; 2× for the Pokémon's original types and 1.2× (4915/4096) for every other type, including Stellar. After a move is used, no other moves of that same type will receive this boost from being Terastallized. In Tera Raid Battles, all moves will be boosted in this manner without limit. In its Stellar Form, Terapagos similarly retains this boost at all times. Stellar-type Tera Blast gains increased base power at the cost of lowering the user’s Attack and Special Attack stats by one stage, and Stellar-type Tera Starstorm changes to hit multiple opponents. Other moves cannot be changed into the Stellar type.


[Tera Raid Battles]


Raid Battles make a return in Pokémon Scarlet & Violet in the form of Tera Raid Battles. Much like how Max Raid Battles used Dynamax in Sword & Shield, Tera Raid Battles are built around the Terastal Phenomenon.

Throughout Paldea, you will find sparkling pillars of light that come from various crystals across the region. If you go to these, you will start a Tera Raid Battle. These can be done alone or with friends. Tera Raid Battles will sometimes feature Pokémon with a differing type to their usual type. Due to being done with friends, even though some Tera Raid Battles are available natively only in one game, matching the Version Exclusives, other players can participate in them and catch them regardless of what game they're playing. Each Raid Boss Level has a different Hit Point multiplier to calculate the maximum HP of the boss

Unlike Pokémon Sword & Shield, the Tera Raid Battles are not in set locations with the location determining the raid you get. Instead, they get randomly placed throughout the region with the Tera Type of the Pokémon also being random. These reset as you clear them out and as the day passes to the next day.

After completing story elements after the Academy Ace Tournament, you'll then unlock 6 Star Raid Battles through a story with Jacq asking you to investigate Raid Battles. Defeat over a dozen and he'll call and unlock 6 Star for you. There is only one of these in Paldea at any one time and the opponent is of a higher level than the one you actually catch making them a considerable challenge. Due to this, the items you obtain are rarer.

Whenever you first access a Tera Raid Battle den, you will receive 500 LP for 1 Star Raids, 700 for 2 Star Raids, 1,000 LP for 3 Star Raids, 1200 for 4 Star Raids, 1600 for 5 Star Raids, 1800 LP for a 6 Star Raid or 2,000 LP for a 7 star Raid.

Tera Raid Battles have a change in that they have a time limit and allow for you to continue attacking without waiting for the other players to choose their actions. This allows for you to go through and battle the Pokémon with more haste and ease as before. If your Pokémon is knocked out, then you wait 5 seconds before being brought back in. The overall timer also reduces with each KO that the Raid Boss gets.

Players can also cheer instead of using moves. You can use Cheers three times per Raid Battle. They do not stack and can last up to 6 turns. As of Version 2.1.0, you can see them in the Summary screen when they are in effect.

Go all out! - Gives a *1.5 boost to Attack damage. It has a slim chance of being *2
Hang tough! - Gives a *1.5 boost to the Pokémon's defences. It has a slim chance of being *2
Heal up! - Provides healing of the Pokémon's Hit Points and removes all Status Conditios
With higher star Raid bosses, they can go through up to six extra stages of effects. These vary in order depending on the boss itself and include the following effects:
Use an extra move - This can be an additional move outside its movepool, or one of its movepool moves
Put up a shield - This shield will reduce damage significantly, but damage from Terastallized Pokémon is increased. It will also prevent status moves being used against the Raid Boss. It reduces standard moves to 20% of their possible damage, but if you Terastallize this changes to 35% if a different type or 75% if the same type as your Tera Type
Remove Negative Effects - This removes any status conditions or stat drops on the Raid Boss
Remove Stat Boosts & Abilities - This removes any stat increases on all players' Pokémon, and removes their Ability

From time to time, there will be special events held over the Poké Portal. These are obtained through the Mystery Gift feature of the game and often provide a variety of special Tera Raid Battles focusing on certain Pokémon, sometimes including those not natively available within the game

These Crystals have a special aura around them and have a white glow on the map so you know that they are the special event ones.

In amongst these are the special 7 Star Raid Battles. These battles are the hardest you can face in the game and if you manage to defeat it and catch a Pokémon from it, it will have a special Mark indicating that it was caught in a 7 Star Raid.
